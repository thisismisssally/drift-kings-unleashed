## The Story

It's always been my little boy Albert's dream to have his own video game. Not just to play one — to *design* one. So he sat down and told me exactly what his dream game would be. Every feature, every detail, every cheeky conversation — it's all his.

This repository contains his complete game design, written up as a professional Product Requirements Document and shared as open source. If you're a developer, artist, or just someone who believes kids' dreams deserve to be taken seriously — welcome.

**This is entirely Albert's design. We're just sharing it with the world.**

## The Game In Brief

> **Forza Horizon meets MudRunner meets The Sims — with cheeky talking NPCs and tameable pets.**

- 🗺️ **Three endless maps** — Mud, Drift, and Street — seamlessly connected, no loading screens
- 💬 **AI-powered NPC conversations** — walk up to anyone for cheeky, context-aware British banter
- 🐱 **Tameable cats and dogs** — they ride in your vehicle, react to your driving, and judge you silently
- 👥 **20-player lobbies** — race, explore, drift, or just cause chaos together
- ⛽ **Optional fuel system** — simulation or arcade, your choice
- 🌙 **Real UK time** — live day/night cycle synced to GMT/BST
- 🌧️ **Dynamic weather** — rain, fog, thunderstorms, seasonal snow — all affecting physics
- 🏆 **Silly achievements** — "Bring a sports car into the mud map and regret everything"
